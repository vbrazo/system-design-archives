# System Design

## Client-Server Model

A client is a thing that talks to servers. A server is a thing that talks to clients. The clientâ€”server model is a thing made up of a bunch of clients and servers talking to one another.

And that, kids, is how the Internet works!

### Client

A machine or process that requests data or service from a server.

Note that a single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a
server at the same time. For instance, a single machine could act as a server
for end users and as a client for a database.

### Server

A machine or process that provides data or service for a client, usually by
listening for incoming network calls.

Note that a single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a
server at the same time. For instance, a single machine could act as a server
for end users and as a client for a database.

### Client-Server

The paradigm by which modern systems are designed, which consists of clients
requesting data or service from servers and servers providing data or service
to clients.

### IP Address

An address given to each machine connected to the public internet. IPv4
addresses consist of four numbers separated by dots: `a.b.c.d` where all
four numbers are between 0 and 255. Special values include:

- 127.0.0.1: Your own local machine. Also referred to as
- 192.168.x.y: Your private network. For instance, your machine and all
machines on your private wifi network will usually have the `192.168` prefix.

### Port

In order for multiple programs to listen for new network connections on the
same machine without colliding, they pick a `port` to listen on. A port
is an integer between 0 and 65,535 (2^16 ports total).

Typically, ports 0-1023 are reserved for `system ports` (also called `well-known`
ports) and shouldn't be used by user-level processes.
Certain ports have pre-defined uses, and although you usually won't be
required to have them memorized, they can sometimes come in handy. Below are
some examples:

- 22: Secure Shell
- 53: DNS lookup
- 80: HTTP
- 443: HTTPS

### DNS

Short for Domain Name System, it describes the entities and protocols involved in the
translation from domain names to IP Addresses. Typically, machines make a DNS query to
a well known entity which is responsible for returning the IP address (or multiple ones)
of the requested domain name in the response.
